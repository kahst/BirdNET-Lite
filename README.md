## Introduction
BirdNET-Pi is built on the [BirdNET framework](https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer) by [**@kahst**](https://github.com/kahst) <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY--NC--SA%204.0-lightgrey.svg"></a> using [pre-built TFLite binaries](https://github.com/PINTO0309/TensorflowLite-bin) by [**@PINTO0309**](https://github.com/PINTO0309) . It is able to recognize bird sounds from a USB microphone or sound card in realtime and share its data with the rest of the world.

* [BirdWeather](https://app.birdweather.com) integration -- you can request a BirdWeather ID from BirdNET-Pi's "Tools" > "Settings" page
* Web interface access to all data and logs provided by [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com)
* [GoTTY](https://github.com/yudai/gotty) Web Terminal
* [Tiny File Manager](https://tinyfilemanager.github.io/)
* FTP server included
* SQLite3 Database
* [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) database maintenance

* [Apprise Notifications](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) supporting 70+ notification platforms
* Localization supported

## Requirements
* A Raspberry Pi 4B, Raspberry Pi 400, Raspberry Pi 3B+, or Raspberry Pi 0W2 (The 3B+ and 0W2 must run on RaspiOS-ARM64-**Lite**)
* An SD Card with the **_64-bit version of RaspiOS_** installed (please use Bullseye) -- Lite is recommended, but the installation works on RaspiOS-ARM64-Full as well. Downloads available within the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
* A USB Microphone or Sound Card

## Installation
[A comprehensive installation guide is available here](https://github.com/mcguirepr89/BirdNET-Pi/wiki/Installation-Guide).

Please note that installing BirdNET-Pi on top of other servers is not supported. If this is something that you require, please open a discussion for your idea and inquire about how to contribute to development.

[Raspberry Pi 3B[+] and 0W2 installation guide available here](https://github.com/mcguirepr89/BirdNET-Pi/wiki/RPi0W2-Installation-Guide)

The system can be installed with:
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcguirepr89/BirdNET-Pi/main/newinstaller.sh | bash
```
The installer takes care of any and all necessary updates, so you can run that as the very first command upon the first boot, if you'd like.

The installation creates a log in `$HOME/installation-$(date "+%F").txt`.
## Access
The BirdNET-Pi can be accessed from any web browser on the same network:
- http://birdnetpi.local OR your Pi's IP address
- Default Basic Authentication Username: birdnet
- Password is empty by default. Set this in "Tools" > "Settings" > "Advanced Settings"

## Updating 

Use the web interface and go to "Tools" > "System Controls" > "Update." If you encounter any issues with that, or suspect that the update did not work for some reason, please save its output and post it in an issue where we can help.

## Uninstallation
```
/usr/local/bin/uninstall.sh && cd ~ && rm -drf BirdNET-Pi
```

## Troubleshooting and Ideas
*Hint: A lot of weird problems can be solved by simply restarting the core services. Do this from the web interface "Tools" > "Services" > "Restart Core Services"
Having trouble or have an idea? *Submit an issue for trouble* and a *discussion for ideas*. Please do *not* submit an issue as a discussion -- the issue tracker solicits information that is needed for anyone to help -- discussions are *not for issues*.

PLEASE search the repo for your issue before creating a new one. This repo has nothing to do with the validity of the detection results, so please do not start any issues around "False positives."

## Sharing
Please join a Discussion!! and please join [BirdWeather!!](https://app.birdweather.com)
I hope that if you find BirdNET-Pi has been worth your time, you will share your setup, results, customizations, etc. [HERE](https://github.com/mcguirepr89/BirdNET-Pi/discussions/69) and will consider [making your installation public](https://github.com/mcguirepr89/BirdNET-Pi/wiki/Sharing-Your-BirdNET-Pi).
